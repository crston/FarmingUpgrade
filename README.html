<h4 id="upgraded-harvesting">Upgraded Harvesting</h4>
<ul>
<li>Harvesting a grown crop with a hoe automatically replants the crop.</li>
<li>Hoes do not break crops that are not fully grown.</li>
<li>Hoes harvest grown crops within a range. Wood and Stone have a range of 0, Iron and Gold a range of 1 and Diamond and Netherite a range of 2.</li>
<li>Hoes with higher enchantment levels of Unbreaking have a higher chance to not take damage when harvesting crops.</li>
<li>Hoes with higher enchantment levels of Efficiency increases the range of the hoe. For every 2 levels of Efficiency, the hoe gains 1 range.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="upgraded-farmland-hydration">Upgraded Farmland Hydration</h4>
<p>In Vanilla, water hydrates Farmland within a horizontal range of 4 blocks. Upgraded hydration replaces the Vanilla range with a new horizontal range, height and depth of hydration.</p>
<h4 id="upgraded-farmland-trampling">Upgraded Farmland Trampling</h4>
<p>When a player tramples farmland, the crop that is planted on it is reset to its first growth stage. The farmland itself is not reset to dirt, like in Vanilla.</p>
<h4 id="upgraded-bonemeal">Upgraded Bonemeal</h4>
<p>Bonemeal is weaker but fertilises all adjacent crops too, which makes it slightly stronger than Vanilla bonemeal.</p>
